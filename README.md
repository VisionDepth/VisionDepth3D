### Guide Sheet: GUI Inputs
Below is a guide to help you understand and adjust each parameter in the GUI.

### 1. Codec
- **Description**: Specifies the codec used for encoding the output video.
- **Default**: `mp4v`
- **Options**: 
  - `mp4v` (MP4 format)
  - `XVID` (MKV format)
  - Others supported by OpenCV.

### 2. 3D Output Formats
- **Description**: Specifies the output format used for encoding the output video.
- **Options**: 
  - `Half-SBS / Full-SBS` (For 3D TVs, YouTube 3D)
  - `Half-OU / Full-OU` (For 3D projectors & VR headsets)
  - Others supported by OpenCV.

### 3. Aspect Ratio Selection
- **Description**: Specifies the Aspect Ratio used for encoding the output video.
- **Default**: `Default (16:9)`
- **Options**: 
  - `CinemaScope (2.39:1)` (True cinematic widescreen)
  - `21:9 UltraWide` (Compatible with UltraWide monitors)
  - `4:3 (Classic Films` (Retro-style)
  - `1:1 (Square)` (Social media content)
  - `2.35:1 & 2.76:1` (Advanced widescreen format

### 4. Divergence Shift 
- **Description**: Controls the amount of pixel shift for objects in the foreground.
- **Default**: `4.8`
- **Recommended Range**: `3.0` to `8.0`
- **Effect**: Higher values create a stronger 3D effect for objects closest to the viewer.

### 5. Depth Transition 
- **Description**: Controls the amount of pixel shift for midground objects.
- **Default**: `1.9`
- **Recommended Range**: `1.0` to `5.0`
- **Effect**: Fine-tune this value to balance the depth effect between divergence and convergence.

### 6. Convergence Shift
- **Description**: Controls the amount of pixel shift for Depth.
- **Default**: `-2.8`
- **Recommended Range**: `-5.0` to `0.0`
- **Effect**: Use Negative values to push objects farther back, creating more depth.

### 7. Sharpness Factor
- **Description**: Adjusts the sharpness of the final output video.
- **Default**: `0`
- **Range**: `-1.0` (softer) to `1.0` (sharper)
- **Effect**: Higher values make edges more distinct, but excessive sharpness can introduce artifacts like over brightness.

### 8. Blend Factor (Pulfrich Effect)
- **Description**: Controls the blending ratio between delayed and current frames for the Pulfrich effect.
- **Default**: `0.5`
- **Recommended Range**: `0.3` (subtle) to `0.7` (strong effect)
- **Effect**: Higher values enhance the Pulfrich effect but may make scene transitions harder on the eyes.

### 9. Delay Time (Pulfrich Effect)
- **Description**: Specifies the temporal delay (in seconds) to create the Pulfrich effect.
- **Default**: `1/30`
- **Recommended Range**: `1/50` to `1/20`
- **Effect**: Lower values (e.g., `1/50`) reduce the delay, creating a more subtle effect.

## üìÅ Depth Map File Requirements
### 1. Just Have a Depth map Generated I suggest looking at
- **Depth Anything V2
- **Midas Models
- **DPT Models

## Processing Times
- **Estimated Times**:
  - A 30-second clip: ~15-30 minutes.
  - Full-length videos: ~5-24 hours+.
plus 3D render time

## Example Workflow
1. Select your input video (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mkv`) and output file path.
2. Select your Depth map Video, make sure both video files are same width and  height and FPS 
3. Adjust rendering parameters for the desired 3D effect.
4. Click "Generate 3D Video" to process.

## Troubleshooting
- **Black Screens or Artifacts**:
  - Ensure the depth map matches the input video's resolution and frame rate.
  - Adjust `blend_factor` and `delay_time` for smoother transitions between scenes. this effect is supposed to 
- **Audio Issues**:
  - Verify that the source video contains an audio stream, if not video will be generated with no audio

## Notes
- Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed and available in your system's PATH for audioprocessing. or put ffmpeg.exe in assets folder 
- Depth maps must match the input video dimensions and frame rate.

## Pulfrich Effect Explained
- **How to Use the Pulfrich Effect in Your Program**
-- The Pulfrich effect in your program creates a dynamic 3D experience by introducing a temporal delay between the left and right views, simulating depth perception based on motion. Here's how to use it effectively:

- **Enable Pulfrich Effect**: The effect is automatically applied when generating Half-SBS 3D videos.
It works by blending current and delayed frames to enhance depth perception during motion.

- **Adjust Blend Factor**: Use the Blend Factor slider or parameter to control the intensity of the Pulfrich effect.
Higher values increase the blending between delayed and current frames, while lower values reduce it.

- **Scene Change Handling**: the program detects scene changes automatically and dynamically reduces blending to avoid artifacts in abrupt transitions.
No manual intervention is required for smooth scene transitions.

- **Delay Time Control**: Modify the Delay Time parameter to fine-tune the temporal offset.
A smaller delay creates subtle depth, while a larger delay produces more pronounced effects.
