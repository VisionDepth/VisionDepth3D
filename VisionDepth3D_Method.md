# The VisionDepth3D Method  

An advanced, real-time stereo rendering engine for 2D-to-3D conversion in VR and stereoscopic displays.  
VisionDepth3D introduces multiple **first-of-their-kind techniques** in the 3D conversion community, while also integrating established practices into a single GPU-optimized pipeline.

## üöÄ Original Innovations (Introduced by VisionDepth3D)

### 1. Depth Shaping for ‚ÄúPop Control‚Äù  
* The **`shape_depth_for_pop` algorithm** is unique to VisionDepth3D:  
  1. Percentile stretch of depth range.  
  2. Recentered on subject depth.  
  3. Symmetric gamma curve for controlled ‚Äúpop‚Äù.  
* Enables tunable cinematic or VR-style stereo with consistent subject emphasis.  

---

### 2. Subject-Aware Zero-Parallax Plane with EMA Stabilization  
* Dynamically estimates subject depth (center-weighted histograms + percentiles).  
* Locks the zero-parallax plane to the subject with exponential smoothing.  
* Prevents subject ‚Äúdrift‚Äù and stabilizes the screen plane without manual keyframing.  

---

### 3. Dynamic Parallax Scaling by Scene Variance  
* Computes normalized variance of depth in the central region:  
```python
parallax_scale = compute_dynamic_parallax_scale(depth_tensor)
```  
* Adapts stereo strength automatically ‚Äî gentle for flat shots, expansive for landscapes.  

---

### 4. Edge-Aware Shift Suppression with Gradient Sigmoid Masking  
* Novel use of depth gradients to suppress parallax shifts near thin, detailed edges:  
```python
edge_mask = torch.sigmoid((grad_mag - edge_threshold) * feather_strength * 5)
```  
* Prevents ghosting and halos without AI inpainting.  

---

### 5. Matte Sculpting with Temporal Stabilization  
* Combines distance transforms with EMA smoothing to ‚Äúround‚Äù depth on subjects.  
* Prevents shimmer in hair, fingers, and soft edges.  
* Creates natural curvature without requiring heavy segmentation pipelines.  

---

### 6. Floating Window with Temporal Easing  
* Subject-aware floating window automatically detects window violations.  
* `FloatingWindowTracker` + `FloatingBarEaser` smooth jitter and clamp drift.  
* First real-time system that applies cinematic floating windows automatically.  

---

### 7. Motion-Aware Focal Depth Tracking for DOF  
* Depth-of-field blur controlled by a **focal depth tracker** that adapts to scene motion.  
* Busy shots ‚Üí faster focus shifts; still shots ‚Üí stable focus.  
* Simulates real cinematography rules dynamically during 3D rendering.  

---

### 8. Gradient-Based Healing of Stereo Occlusion Gaps  
* Detects warping gaps via gradient magnitude and fills with blended original + blurred content.  
* Lightweight alternative to neural inpainting ‚Äî seamless and invisible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supporting Features (Implemented, Not Unique)

* **Depth-weighted continuous parallax shifting** ‚Äì smooth stereo gradients instead of discrete layers.  
* **GPU tensor grid warping** ‚Äì CUDA-optimized `grid_sample` per-eye rendering.  
* **Scene-aware dampening** ‚Äì adjusts disparity for flat vs. complex scenes.  
* **Temporal percentile EMA normalization** ‚Äì stabilizes depth scale across frames.  
* **Depth-based DOF (multi-level Gaussian pyramid)** ‚Äì established technique, enhanced in VD3D with motion-aware focus.  
* **Black bar detection & aspect handling** ‚Äì auto-crop and cinematic aspect preservation.  
* **Color grading & sharpening** ‚Äì GPU-accelerated saturation, contrast, brightness, and safe sharpening.  
* **Multi-format 3D output** ‚Äì Half-SBS, Full-SBS, VR, anaglyph, interlaced.  
* **FFmpeg streaming codec pipeline** ‚Äì CPU (libx264/x265/AV1), NVIDIA NVENC, AMD AMF, Intel QSV with CRF/CQ control.
